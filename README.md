## AngularWeather ##

**AngularWeather** is a simple weather app built on [angularJS](https://angularjs.org/). It consumes [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) API for all weather related data.

[DEMO](http://weather.prashantpalikhe.com)

### App information ###

App is built as a result of experimenting with AngularJS.

It simply displays the current weather condition for the city given by the user along with a week forecast. The units can be switched between metric and imperial.

If no city is given, the app tries to load the user's local weather data using HTML5 Geo-location API.

The app updates the route according to the city entered by the user and is therefore bookmarkable.

e.g. [http://weather.prashantpalikhe.com/#/toronto](http://weather.prashantpalikhe.com/#/toronto)
